# Project AI Guide (Claude)
You MUST follow the shared rules in /AI/COMMON/.

## Quick summary
- Coding standards → /AI/COMMON/coding-standards.md
- GitHub PR summary format → /AI/COMMON/github-pr-summary.md

## Execution shortcuts (for Claude)
- When asked for PR summary, open `/AI/COMMON/github-pr-summary.md` and apply it.
- Prefer TDD and small diffs; run tests before refactor (see `/AI/COMMON/workflows.md`).
